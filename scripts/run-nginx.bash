# Ok so for relative paths, Nginx uses the prefix path as prefix.
# But we want to have a path relative to the working directory.
# But inside the Nginx configuration, you canâ€™t retrieve the working directory.
# So we generate a file that contains it absolute, and include it in nginx.conf.
echo "alias $PWD/adatipd/static/;" > state/nginx/alias_static.conf;
